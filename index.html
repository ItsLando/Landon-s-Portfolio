    <P>As an aspiring Web Developer, I want to develop the skills necessary to not only represent my clients in the rapidly evolving sphere of the world wide web, but to also make the experience of the user more enjoyable and intuitive.</P>

    <p>I'm a produce clerk by trade whos been practing programming in my free time. I've delved into various professions
      searching for the right fit, from medicine to civil engineering, and from a restaurateur to a pilot. Finally I've found my calling in the realm of web development.</p>

  <div class="body-goals">
    <h2>Goals:</h2>
    <p>I'd be privileged to work alongside knowledgable and capable Web Developers so that I too can be relied on to perform intermediate and eventually senior level responsibilities.</p>
    <p>Holistically, I want to provide clients with intuitive interfaces and modern web designs so that their users will commend their brand in the online world. The world wide web is constantly changing and evolving, and the ever-increasing importance of an online brand is crucial to the success of any modern organization.</p>
